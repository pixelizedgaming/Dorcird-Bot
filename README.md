##Excuse the name

This is a discord bot that just takes the most recent comments left by the command executor and tagged person, and puts them into a char vs wojak meme and posts it. 
made it as a joke, also as an excuse to myself to try python after sitting in my chair doing nothing for too long. 

also first impressions of python: wow its easier to write with. i feel like in java I would've had to write like everything completely on my own but with python libraries
its so much easier
